# Destructible 2D pixel terrain in unity
Scorched earth / worms / cortex command like terrain in unity.

Runs at very good framerate on my pc so it should work on mobile too.

You can change the block size and it creates terrain from an image, not procedurally.

It automatically splits it into chunks and generates a collder.

You can easly change the block and chunk size from the inspector.

So you could very easily edit this to make a terraria like game.

This project just includes basic destruction and collider demonstration, no ai or fancy explosions.
